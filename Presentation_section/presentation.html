						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						</center>
					</section>				
					<section>
						In the past, composers often employed techniques like inversion, retrograde or sections of music to expand upon the original musical content. However, these techniques gradually lost their appeal and were seen as tiresome. 
					</section>
					<section data-background="img/giphy.gif">
						Music variation offers a solution to the limitations of older techniques.
					</section>
					<section>
						Music variation serves as a catalyst for creative thinking in the songwriting process. It offers flexibility, capable of generating patterns ranging from close replicas to entirely different ones. The outcome depends on the composer's desires. When applied to compositions, it's like creating another version of the same song, making the music open to change every time it's heard. This technique opens up possibilities for composers to create entirely new musical patterns without being tied to the original framework. Individuals can transform the written notes into their own unique dynamic and fresh music.

						Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have significantly advanced, enabling them to create music with ever-increasing proficiency$^1$.

						However, these technologies often require high computational resources, making them unable to run on devices with low processing power. Additionally, some AI music composition tools may produce music in limited styles.

						Since limitations of AI music technology is an expensive problem to leave unaddressed, the following consequences it may lead to. Firstly, aspiring artists and musicians will miss out on the opportunity to use these tools due to limited access, as most people lack high-performance equipment. Furthermore, all music generated by AI may start to sound similar, potentially leading to a lack of musical diversity. 
					</section>
					<section>						
						The paper thus aims to address the aforementioned issue by employing a multi-step process. Initially, it utilizes melodic variation with expanded rhythm, which is then translated into numerical values. These numerical values are then input into a chaotic dynamical system, resulting in a new set of numbers different from the original. Finally, these numbers are mapped back to musical notes, resulting in the creation of a new piece of music. This method requires lower computing resources compared to using AI music composition technology and allows for the creation of diverse musical compositions depending on the original song, initial values, and equations used.

					    <h3>Music Theory: Musical note</h3>
					    <center>
					    <img src="img/notepitch.JPG" alt="notepitch" style="height: 100%; width:100%;">
					    </center>
					    In music theory, a musical note is a symbol on a staff that represents pitch, which refers to the highness or lowness of a sound. Notes are typically represented by the letters A through G and incorporates numbers to specify the precise pitch of a musical note.

					    Additionally, each musical note has a duration symbol that specifies how long it should be played. Durations are typically defined using the unit beat, which refers to a chosen time interval.

						<h3>Chaotic Systems</h3>
						Chaotic refers to a system that appears complex behavior, where small changes in initial conditions can lead to different outcomes.
						<br>
						<br>
						A chaotic system is characterized by three fundamental properties as follows
						<ol>
							<li>Aperiodic long-term behavior: these systems never settle into predictable patterns. </li>
							<li>Deterministic: their complex behavior arises solely from the internal interactions within the system, without any random inputs or external noise. </li>
							<li>Sensitive dependence on initial conditions: small changes at the initial conditions can lead to very different outcomes.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Example of application</h3>
						One of the well-known chaotic systems is the Lorentz system$^5$, a dynamical system with parameters $\sigma > 0$, $r > 0$ and $b > 0$ given by:
						\[
						\begin{aligned}
						\dot{x}_1 &= \sigma(x_2 - x_1), \\
						\dot{x}_2 &= rx_1 - x_2 - x_1x_3, \\
						\dot{x}_3 &= x_1x_2 - bx_3.
						\end{aligned}
						\]
						For an instance if parameters set to $\sigma = 10$, $r = 28$ and $b = \dfrac{8}{3}$, it exhibits chaotic behavior, as illustrated in next slide . This figure shows the aperiodic long-term behavior, its deterministic nature and its sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

						<h3>Musical variations from a chaotic mapping</h3>
						In 1996, Dabby$^6$ introduced a compelling approach for crafting musical variations by leveraging the chaotic dynamics described by Lorentz system. This method capitalizes on the system's responsiveness to initial conditions and its non-repetitive nature. It entails translating a portion of the system's numerical output into musical notes, creating a secondary trajectory with a new initial conditions, and subsequently establishing a sequence of notes derived from this translation. This process yields an new musical variation of the musical piece.

						<h3>Main Result</h3>

					<section>
						<h3>Mathematical Notation</h3>
						Throughout this section, we use the following notation. Denote $\mathbb{R}$ the set of real numbers, $\mathbb{N}$ the set of natural numbers and $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ the set of positive real numbers. For any fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we denote $\mathbb{N}_n := \{ 1, 2, \dots, n \}$, $\mathbb{R}^n$ the $n$-dimensional euclidean space and $\{ a_k \}_{k=0}^{n} = \{ a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \}$ a sequence of real numbers. Denote $ \left\lVert x \right\rVert$ the euclidean norm of vector $x$. A function $f$ is injective if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies $x_1 = x_2$. Denote $\text{dom } f$ the domain of the function $f$. A dynamical system
						\[
						\dot{x}(t) = f(t, x)
						\] 
						is composed through a system of ordinary differential equations, where $\dot{x}(t)$ represents the derivative of $x(t)$ with respect to time. 
						The point $x^* \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is called an equilibrium point of the dynamical system if $f(t, x^*) = 0 $ for all $t \geq 0$.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Musical Variations from a Chaotic Mapping Method</h3>
						Consider a sheet music with $m$ being a positive integer representing the number of notes, and $\displaystyle\{p_k\}_{k=0}^{m-1}$ being a sequence of musical pitches. Let
						\[ \dot{x}(t) = f(t,x) \]
						define a chaotic dynamical system with an initial condition $x(0) \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where $f: \mathbb{R}_{+} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a continuous function. <br>
						Given a sequence $\{\phi_i(kh)\}_{k=0}^{m-1}$, where $\phi_i:\mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}$ is a numerical solution in the $i$-th component of the chaotic dynamical system for some $i \in \mathbb{N}_n$ and a step size $h$, we define a mapping $g$ as
						\[ g(\phi_i(kh)) := p_k \]
						for all $k \in \{0\}\cup\mathbb{N}_{m-1}$.
					</section>
					<section>
						To generate a new variation of the music, we consider $\{\tilde{\phi}_i(kh)\}_{k=0}^{m-1}$ as a sequence of a new trajectory with the initial condition $\tilde{x}(0) \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where $\tilde{\phi}_i$ is a numerical solution in the $i$-th component to the chaotic dynamical system, and $\tilde{x}(0)$ is located not far from $x(0)$, i.e., $\left\lVert x(0) - \tilde{x}(0) \right\rVert \leq d$ for some small positive number $d \in \mathbb{R}$.
						We then define another mapping $l$ as:
						\[
						l(\tilde{\phi}_i(kh)) :=
						\begin{cases}
						g(\phi_i(b)) & \text{if } \exists\; a, b \in \text{dom } \phi_i \text{ s.t. } \phi_i(a) < \tilde{\phi}_i(kh) \leq \phi_i(b) \\
						& \text{ and } \nexists\, c \in \text{dom } \phi_i \text{ s.t. } \phi_i(a) < \phi_i(c) \leq \phi_i(b), \\
						g(\phi_i(a)) & \text{if } \tilde{\phi}_i(kh) < \phi_i(a) \text{ for all } a \in \text{dom } \phi_i, \\
						g(\phi_i(b)) & \text{otherwise},
						\end{cases}
						\]
						resulting in the sequence $\{l(\tilde{\phi}_i(kh))\}_{k=0}^{m-1}$, which represents a new variation of the original musical pitch.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Melodic Variation with Expanded Rhythm Method</h3>
						Let $\{p_k\}_{k=0}^{m-1}$ denote a sequence of music pitches. We can then establish a sequence of expanded music pitches $\{p^\prime_k\}_{k=0}^{mq-1}$, where $q$ is a positive integer representing the number of expanded notes for each $p_k$. Additionally, we set $p_k = p^\prime_{kq} = p^\prime_{kq + 1} = \dots = p^\prime_{q(k + 1) - 1}$.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Example: Expanded Rhythm</h3>
						<center>
						<img src="img/example1.JPG" alt="notepitch" style="height: 60%; width:60%;">
						</center>
						The sequence $ \{p_k\}_{k=0}^{3} = \{ C4, C4, G4, G4 \} $ represents the sequence of musical pitches in the first bar of the music piece "Ah vous dirai-je Maman," as illustrated in (a).
						Assuming $q = 4$ denotes the number of expanded notes for each $p_k$, we can establish an expanded sequence of musical pitches $ \{p^\prime_k\}_{k=0}^{15} = \{ C4, C4, C4, C4, C4, C4, C4, C4, G4, \\ G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4 \} $,
						illustrated in (b).
					</section>
					<section> 
						<h3>Example: Melodic Variation with Expanded Rhythm Method</h3>
						Considering the sequence \[\{p_k\}_{k=0}^{11} = \{C4, C4, G4, G4, A4, A4, G4, F4, F4, E4, E4\}\] represents the first 3 bar of the music piece "Ah vous dirai-je Maman," we proceed with the steps detailed in musical variations from a chaotic mapping method to transition to the sequence $\{p^\prime_k\}_{k=0}^{15}$ as exemplified in expanded rhythm example. 

						Consequently, a sequence of new pitches is obtained:
						\[\begin{aligned} 
						\{l(\tilde{\phi}_1(kh))\}_{k = 0}^{15} = \{&C4, G4, D4, A4, A4, E4, F4, F4, F4, F4, \\ 
																   &E4, G4, D4, C4, C4, C4 \}, 
						\end{aligned}\]
						which the illustration is depicted in next slide.
