Numerical results using phase portraits, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, and 0-1 testing confirmed chaotic and hyperchaotic behavior. The results also proved the effectiveness of the control, showing errors below 1\%, even in cases where the control design is subject to parametric errors. Additionally, an investigation of the system in fractional order is included, demonstrating that the system has periodic, constant, or chaotic behavior for specific values of the order of the derivative.},

For this purpose, we analyze the dynamics of a mixed duopoly game with two decision parameters: price and quality of service (QoS). We calculate and discuss the stability of each equilibrium solution by using the nonlinear system. A numerical simulation is used to show the flip bifurcation to chaos by the decisions of ISPs with different statuses. We discovered that the Nash equilibrium loses stability when the speed of adjustment and transmission fee increase. We show that the system parameter changes the stability of the communication market. In addition, we use a control method to keep the communication market in a stable state.},
